            It was an ordinary summer day, it was hot as hell outside, and the
            daily routine dragged our main characters into its abyss. The time
            for studying is long gone, so it's time to think of something to do
            for this summer vacation. There were many different ideas: go hiking
            and tell scary stories all night, go on a beach picnic near the
            river, walk for the hundredth time in the park and look at ancient
            Buddhist temples, gather for an overnight stay with friends, or
            maybe just sleep all day and wait for the start school year?

            But all this was already in the past and the year before last, it's
            time to come up with something fresh. Suddenly, an excellent idea
            appeared, how to spend these summer holidays on the shores of the
            sea. All the girls loved the idea and began to prepare for the beach
            trip. The main thing is not to forget the swimwear. It remains only
            to decide where to go. One of the girls remembered that she has a
            brother in the town of Maizuru. There are just excellent golden
            beaches and a warm sea where you can spend the whole day. Without
            thinking twice, the girls said at once: ''Done!! We will spend this
            summer vacation in

            The night after taking such an important decision was the longest
            one. No one can sleep and the girls chatted all night to come up
            with as many interesting activities as possible for this epic
            vacation. Finally, the night passed and it was time to get ready for
            the journey. It took several hours, but was undoubtedly worth it.
            When the girls arrived in the town of   <Typography

            best vacation of their lives.
